today I learned:-
commands:-

grep- to search keywords.
grep -E- to search more then one keywords at a time.
uniq -c- to cout the number of unique lines.
sort- to sort the lines.
tail -f- to check real time breaches. 
wc -l- to count lines.
wc -c- to count letters.
wc -w- to count words.
ls -a- to see hidden files. 
to create hiiden files by .file.txt.
chown- to change the owner.
chmod- to change modes.
sudo- sudo add user; sudo chown.
ls -l- to see the permissions.
cat error.log attacker.log> all_logs.log

Mini project-1

created a director mini_project1
created 2 logs attacker.log and error.log
then write 5 breaches in each
then combine both in one log i.e. all_logs.log 
catch them by all commands like
grep,grep-E,sort,uniq-c,tail-f.
